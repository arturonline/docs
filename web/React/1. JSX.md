# JSX

Grammar in JSX is mostly the same as in HTML, but there are subtle differences to watch out for.

## JSX Outer Elements

The first opening tag and the final closing tag of a JSX expression must belong to the same JSX element.

If you notice that a JSX expression has multiple outer elements, you can simple wrap the JSX expression in a `<div> </div>`, or a react fragment: `<> </>`

In other words, this code will work:

```jsx
const paragraphs = (
  <div id="i-am-the-outermost-element">
    <p>I am a paragraph.</p>
    <p>I, too, am a paragraph.</p>
  </div>
);
```

But this code will not work:

```jsx
const paragraphs = (
  <p>I am a paragraph.</p>
  <p>I, too, am a paragraph.</p>
);
```

## class vs className

JSX gets translated into JavaScript, and class is a reserved word in JavaScript, so in JSX, you canâ€™t use the word `class`. You have to use `className`:

```jsx
<h1 className="big">Hey</h1>
```

## for vs htmlfor

Exactly same as above. for is a reserved word, so in JSX you should use `htmlfor`.

## Self-Closing Tags

Most HTML elements use two tags: an opening tag `<div>`, and a closing tag `</div>`. However, some HTML elements such as `<img>` and `<input>` use only one tag.

When you write a single tag in JSX, you have to include the slash. If you write a self-closing tag in JSX and forget the slash, you will raise an error:

Fine in HTML:

```jsx
<br />

<br> // Error!
```

## Curly Braces in JSX

Any code in between the tags of a JSX element will be read as JSX, not as regular JavaScript. But, you can inject javascript by wrapping the code in curly braces:

```jsx
ReactDOM.render(<h1>{2 + 3}</h1>, document.getElementById("app"));
// 5
```

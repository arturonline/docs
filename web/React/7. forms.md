# Forms

HTML form elements keep some internal state. But in most cases, it’s convenient to have a JavaScript function that handles the submission of the form and has access to the data that the user entered into the form. The standard way to achieve this is with a technique called “controlled components”.

## Controlled Components

In HTML, form elements such as `<input>`, `<textarea>`, and `<select>` typically maintain their own state and update it based on user input. In React, mutable state is typically kept in the state property of components, and only updated with `setState()`.

We can combine the two by making the React state be the *“single source of truth”*. Then the React component that renders a form also controls what happens in that form on subsequent user input. An input form element whose value is controlled by React in this way is called a “controlled component”.

To do so, every state mutation will have an associated handler function:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function NameForm() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState('');

  const handleChange = (event) => {
    setValue(event.target.value);
  };

  const handleSubmit = (event) => {
    alert('A name was submitted: ' + value);
    event.preventDefault();
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <label>
        Name:
        <input type="text" value={value} onChange={handleChange} />
      </label>
      <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
    </form>
  );
}
```

Since the value attribute is set on our form element, the displayed value will always be this.state.value, making the React state the source of truth. Since handleChange runs on every keystroke to update the React state, the displayed value will update as the user types.

## Examples

### Text area

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function EssayForm() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState('Please write an essay about your favorite DOM element.');

  const handleChange = (event) => {
    setValue(event.target.value);
  };

  const handleSubmit = (event) => {
    alert('An essay was submitted: ' + value);
    event.preventDefault();
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <label>
        Essay:
        <textarea value={value} onChange={handleChange} />
      </label>
      <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
    </form>
  );
}
```

### The select tag

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function FlavorForm() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState('coconut');

  const handleChange = (event) => {
    setValue(event.target.value);
  };

  const handleSubmit = (event) => {
    alert('Your favorite flavor is: ' + value);
    event.preventDefault();
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <label>
        Pick your favorite flavor:
        <select value={value} onChange={handleChange}>
          <option value="grapefruit">Grapefruit</option>
          <option value="lime">Lime</option>
          <option value="coconut">Coconut</option>
          <option value="mango">Mango</option>
        </select>
      </label>
      <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
    </form>
  );
}
```

> You can pass an array into the value attribute, allowing you to select multiple options in a select tag:
`<select multiple={true} value={['B', 'C']}>`

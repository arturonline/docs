# Child Components Update Their Parents' state

A stateful parent component passes down an event handler to a stateless child component. The child component then uses that event handler to update its parent’s `state`.

Here’s how that works:

## #1

1. The parent component class defines a method(`.handleClick()`) that calls `this.setState()`
2. and binds the newly-defined method to the current instance of the component in its **constructor** with `.bind(this)`.
3. Once the parent has defined a method that updates its state and bound to it, the parent then passes that method down to a child.

```jsx
//Step1.js
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { ChildClass } from './ChildClass';

function ParentClass() {
  const [totalClicks, setTotalClicks] = useState(0);

  const handleClick = () => {
    setTotalClicks(totalClicks + 1);
  };

  return (
    <ChildClass onClick={handleClick} />
  );
}
```

## #2

The child receives the passed-down function, and uses it as an event handler. When a user clicks on the `<button></button>`, a click event will fire. This will make the passed-down function get called, which will update the parent’s state.

```jsx
// Step2.js

export function ChildClass({ onClick }) {
  return (
    <button onClick={onClick}>
      Click Me!
    </button>
  );
}
```

# Flex Layout

🔗 [Tutorial Link](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)

## **Init a flex container**

Define a flex container:

```css
.container {
  display: flex
}
```

  <img src="./resources/01-container.svg" style="width:250px; Height:150px;" alt="containers">

Tenemos 2 tipos de propiedades:

- Propiedades de la clase .container
- Propiedades de los hijos

## **1. Properties for the Container**

### **Direction**

This establishes the main direction flex items are placed in the flex container. Flexbox is a single-direction layout concept.

```css
.container {
    flex-direction: row | row-reverse | column | column-reverse;
}
```

- **row (default)**: left -> right
- **row-reverse**: right <- left
- **column**: top to bottom
- **column-reverse**: bottom to top

  <img src="./resources/flex-direction.svg" style="width:250px; Height:150px;">

### **flex-wrap**

By default, flex items will all try to fit onto one line. You can change that and allow the items to wrap as needed with this property.

```css
.container {
  flex-wrap: nowrap | wrap | wrap-reverse;
}
```

- **nowrap** (default): all flex items will be on one line. (Els elements es fan mes menuts per poder caber si el contenidor no es prou gran)
- **wrap**: flex items will wrap onto multiple lines, from top to bottom.
- **wrap-reverse**: flex items will wrap onto multiple lines from bottom to top.

  <img src="./resources/flex-wrap.svg" style="width:250px; Height:150px;">

### **Flex-Flow**

This is a shorthand for the **flex-direction** and **flex-wrap** properties, which together define the flex container’s main and cross axes. The default value is **row nowrap**.

```css
.container {
  flex-flow: column wrap;
}
```

### **Justify-Content** (alineación horizontal)

- Trabaja en el eje de las **X**.
- Util para trabajar con una sola linea de elementos.

```css
.container {
  justify-content: flex-start | flex-end | center | space-between | space-around | space-evenly | start | end | left | right ... + safe | unsafe;
}
```

- **flex-start**(default): items are packed toward the start of the flex-direction.
- **flex-end**: items are packed toward the end of the flex-direction.
- **start**: items are packed toward the start of the writing-mode direction.
- **end**: items are packed toward the end of the writing-mode direction.
- **left**: items are packed toward left edge of the container, unless that doesn’t make sense with the flex-direction, then it behaves like start.
- **right**: items are packed toward right edge of the container, unless that doesn’t make sense with the flex-direction, then it behaves like end.
- **center**: items are centered along the line
- **space-between**: items are evenly distributed in the line; first item is on the start line, last item on the end line
- **space-around**: items are evenly distributed in the line with equal space around them. Note that visually the spaces aren’t equal, since all the items have equal space on both sides. The first item will have one unit of space against the container edge, but two units of space between the next item because that next item has its own spacing that applies.
- **space-evenly**: items are distributed so that the spacing between any two items (and the space to the edges) is equal.

⚠ Note that that browser support for these values is nuanced. For example, space-between never got support from some versions of Edge, and start/end/left/right aren’t in Chrome yet. MDN has detailed charts. The safest values are flex-start, flex-end, and center.

There are also two additional keywords you can pair with these values: safe and unsafe. Using safe ensures that however you do this type of positioning, you can’t push an element such that it renders off-screen (e.g. off the top) in such a way the content can’t be scrolled too (called “data loss”).

### **align-items** (alineación vertical)

- Trabaja en el eje de las **Y**.
- Util con una sola linea de elementos.

```css
.container {
  align-items: stretch | flex-start | flex-end | center | baseline | first baseline | last baseline | start | end | self-start | self-end + ... safe | unsafe;
}
```

- **stretch** (default): stretch to fill the container (cambia el tamaño, pero still respect min-width/max-width)
- **flex-start** / **start** / **self-start**: items are placed at the start of the cross axis. The difference between these is subtle, and is about respecting the flex-direction rules or the writing-mode rules.
- **flex-end** / **end** / **self-end**: items are placed at the end of the cross axis. The difference again is subtle and is about respecting flex-direction rules vs. writing-mode rules.
- **center**: items are centered in the cross-axis
- **baseline**: items are aligned such as their baselines align

### **align-content** (alineación de X + Y)

- Trabaja en el eje de las **X** y las **Y**.
- Util para trabajar con más de una linea para tratarlas como si solo fueran una.

```css
.container {
  align-content: flex-start | flex-end | center | space-between | space-around | space-evenly | stretch | start | end | baseline | first baseline | last baseline + ... safe | unsafe;
}
```

- **normal** (default): items are packed in their default position as if no value was set.
- **flex-start** / **start**: items packed to the start of the container. The (more supported) flex-start honors the flex-direction while start honors the writing-mode direction.
- **flex-end** / **end**: items packed to the end of the container. The (more support) flex-end honors the flex-direction while end honors the writing-mode direction.
- **center**: items centered in the container
- **space-between**: items evenly distributed; the first line is at the start of the container while the last one is at the end
- **space-around**: items evenly distributed with equal space around each line
- **space-evenly**: items are evenly distributed with equal space around them
- **stretch**: lines stretch to take up the remaining space

## **2. Children Properties (flex items)**

  <img src="./resources/02-items.svg" style="width:250px; Height:150px;">

### **Order**
  
By default, flex items are laid out in the source order. However, the `order` property controls the order in which they appear in the flex container.

```css
.item {
  order: 5; /* default is 0 */
}
```
  
  <img src="./resources/order.svg" style="width:350px; Height:250px;">

### **flex-grow**

This defines the ability for a flex item to grow if necessary. It accepts a unitless value that serves as a proportion. It dictates what amount of the available space inside the flex container the item should take up.

If all items have `flex-grow` set to 1, the remaining space in the container will be distributed equally to all children. If one of the children has a value of 2, the remaining space would take up twice as much space as the others.

<img src="./resources/flex-grow.svg" style="width:250px; Height:150px;">

```css
.item {
  flex-grow: 4; /* default 0 */
}
```

### **flex-shrink**

This defines the ability for a flex item to shrink up until its defined width.

```css
.item {
  flex-shrink: 3; /* default 1 */
}
```

### **flex-basis**

This defines the default size of an element before the remaining space is distributed. It can be a length (e.g. 20%, 5rem, etc.) or a keyword. The auto keyword means “look at my width or height property” (which was temporarily done by the main-size keyword until deprecated). The content keyword means “size it based on the item’s content” – this keyword isn’t well supported yet, so it’s hard to test and harder to know what its brethren max-content, min-content, and fit-content do.

```css
.item {
  flex-basis:  | auto; /* default auto */
}
```

If set to 0, the extra space around content isn’t factored in. If set to auto, the extra space is distributed based on its `flex-grow` value. See this graphic.

### **flex**

This is the shorthand for `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink` and `flex-basis` combined. The second and third parameters (`flex-shrink` and `flex-basis`) are optional. The default is `0 1 auto`, but if you set it with a single number value, it’s like `1 0`.

```css
.item {
  flex: none | [ <'flex-grow'> <'flex-shrink'>? || <'flex-basis'> ]
}
```

It is recommended that you use this shorthand property rather than set the individual properties. The shorthand sets the other values intelligently.

### **align-self**

- En el eje vertical.
- **No** tiene mas prioridad que el contenedor.

```css
.item {
  align-self: auto | flex-start | flex-end | center | baseline | stretch;
}
```

This allows the default alignment (or the one specified by `align-items`) to be overridden for individual flex items.

⚠ Note that *float*, *clear* and *vertical-align* have no effect on a flex item.

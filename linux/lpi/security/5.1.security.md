# Basic Security and Identifying User Types

## Users & Accounts

### Identifiers

*UID* stands for user identifier. A *UID* is a number assigned to each
Linux user. It is the userâ€™s representation in the Linux kernel.

The *UID* is used for identifying the user within the system and for
determining which system resources the user can access. This is why the
user ID should be unique.

Groups in Linux are defined by *GIDs* (group IDs).

By default on Linux systems, every user is assigned to a group with the
same name as their username, and same GID as his UID. E.g., create a new
user named *newuser* and, by default, its default group is *newuser* as
well.

ðŸ”‘ On Linux, the superuser account is *root*, which always has *UID* 0.
The default group for the superuser has the *GID* 0 and is also named
root.

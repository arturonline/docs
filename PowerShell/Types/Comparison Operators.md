# Comparison Operators

Use comparison operators (`-eq`, `-ne`, `-gt`, `-lt`, `-le`, `-ge`) to compare values and test conditions.

The comparison operators include:

- **match** operators (`-match`, `-notmatch`), which find patterns by using regular expressions;
- **replace** operator (`-replace`), which uses regular expressions to change input values;
- **like** operators (`-like`, `-notlike`), which find patterns using wildcard characters (`*`);
- **containment** operators (`-in`, `-notin`, `-contains`, `-notcontains`), which determine whether a test value appears in a reference set.

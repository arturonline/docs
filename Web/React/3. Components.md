# Components

React applications are made out of components.

A component is a small, reusable chunk of code that is usually responsible for one job, that job is often to render some HTML.

There is two types of components:

## #1. Stateless Functional Components

This function is a valid React component because it accepts a single `props` object argument with data and returns a React element.

```jsx
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```

## #2. Class Components

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(<MyComponentClass />, document.getElementById("app"));
```

## Creating a Component Instance

To make an instance of a `React component`, you write a JSX element.

```jsx
<MyComponentClass />
```

JSX elements can be either HTML, or component instances. JSX uses capitalization to distinguish between the two. In a JSX element, that capitalized first letter says, “I will be a component instance and not an HTML tag.”

## Components Interacting

React apps are made out of components, but what makes React special isn’t components themselves. What makes React special is the ways in which components interact.

```jsx
class Example extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello world</h1>;
  }
}
```

Render methods can also return another kind of JSX: component instances.

```jsx
class OMG extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Whooaa!</h1>;
  }
}

class Crazy extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <OMG />;
  }
}
```

In the above example, Crazy‘s render method returns an instance of the OMG component class. You could say that Crazy renders an `<OMG />`.

Another Example:

```jsx
// Greeting.js

import React from 'react';

export class Greeting extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hi there, {this.props.name}!</h1>;
  }
}
```

```jsx
// app.js

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import {Greeting} from './Greeting'

class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>
          Hullo and, "Welcome to The Newzz," "On Line!"
        </h1>
        <Greeting name="hola"/>
        <article>
          Latest newzz:  where is my phone?
        </article>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('app'));
```
